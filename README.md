# About

DFS Visualizer is a GUI created for users to place vertices and edges to create a graph. Clicking the next button will preform a depth first search on the given graph.
While the algorithim is running it will show the client what the program is actually doing.

A vertex has three stages:
* Unexplored: White
* Exploring: Gray
* Finished: Black

You are able to spawn in as many verticies as you wish and can connect them via the text boxes at the bottom left.
